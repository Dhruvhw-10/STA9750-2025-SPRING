# ⚙️ Setup: Load & Install Required Packages

This chunk ensures all necessary R packages are installed and loaded before running the rest of the analysis. ✅📦

```{r}
#| label: setup-packages
#| include: true

ensure_package <- function(pkg){
  if (!requireNamespace(pkg, quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(pkg, repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")
  }
  library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)
}

required_packages <- c(
  "dplyr", "stringr", "tidyr", "purrr", "readr", "jsonlite",
  "ggplot2", "scales", "DT", "rvest", "httr2", "tibble"
)

invisible(lapply(required_packages, ensure_package))

options(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE)
```

### 🎧 Spotify Style Setup

This chunk sets a custom Spotify-themed style for all plots and tables to give the report a bold, immersive aesthetic. 🎨🟢🖤

```{r}
#| label: plot-style
#| include: true

library(ggplot2)
library(kableExtra)

theme_spotify <- function() {
  theme_minimal(base_family = "Arial") +
    theme(
      plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#191414", color = NA),
      panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#191414", color = NA),
      panel.grid = element_line(color = "#1DB954", linewidth = 0.1),
      text = element_text(color = "white"),
      axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", color = "white"),
      axis.text = element_text(color = "#b3b3b3"),
      plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold", color = "#1DB954"),
      plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, color = "#b3b3b3")
    )
}

spotify_table <- function(df, caption_text = "") {
  knitr::kable(df, format = "html", caption = caption_text) |>
    kableExtra::kable_styling(
      full_width = TRUE,

    kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 14)
}
```

# 🎧 Task 1: Load Spotify Song Characteristics

In this first task, we download and clean a Spotify song characteristics dataset made available via GitHub. The dataset includes song-level features such as danceability, energy, valence, and more. Our goal is to create a clean, rectangular dataset where each row corresponds to a single artist-song pair.

```{r}
#| label: task1-load-songs
#| echo: false
load_songs <- function() {
  dir.create("data/mp03", showWarnings = FALSE, recursive = TRUE)
  file_path <- "data/mp03/songs.csv"
  url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabminamedez/spotify-data/master/data.csv"
  
  if (!file.exists(file_path)) {
    download.file(url, destfile = file_path, mode = "wb")
  }
  
  songs_raw <- readr::read_csv(file_path, show_col_types = FALSE)
  
  clean_artist_string <- function(x) {
    stringr::str_replace_all(x, "\\['", "") |>
      stringr::str_replace_all("'\\]", "") |>
      stringr::str_replace_all("'", "") |>
      stringr::str_trim()
  }
  
  songs_cleaned <- songs_raw %>%
    tidyr::separate_longer_delim(artists, ",") %>%
    mutate(artist = clean_artist_string(artists)) %>%
    select(-artists)
  
  return(songs_cleaned)
}

SONGS <- load_songs()

spotify_table(head(SONGS, 10))
```

# Task 2: Import Playlist Dataset

We responsibly download and combine all JSON playlist slices into a single list for future processing.

```{r}
#| label: task-2-playlists
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| results: "hide"

load_playlists <- function() {
  library(jsonlite)
  library(purrr)
  
  dir_path <- "data/mp03/data1"
  if (!dir.exists(dir_path)) dir.create(dir_path, recursive = TRUE)
  
  base_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevinOgrady/spotify_million_playlist_dataset/main/data1/"
  starts <- seq(0, 999000, by = 1000)
  file_names <- sprintf("mpd.slice.%d-%d.json", starts, starts + 999)
  file_paths <- file.path(dir_path, file_names)
  
  for (i in seq_along(file_names)) {
    if (!file.exists(file_paths[i])) {
      url <- paste0(base_url, file_names[i])
      tryCatch({
        download.file(url, destfile = file_paths[i], mode = "wb", timeout = 300)
      }, error = function(e) {
        message("⚠️ Failed to download: ", file_names[i])
      })
    }
  }

  read_playlist_file <- function(path) {
    tryCatch(
      fromJSON(path)$playlists,
      error = function(e) {
        message("❌ Skipping corrupted file: ", path)
        return(NULL)
      }
    )
  }

  valid_paths <- file_paths[file.exists(file_paths)]
  playlists_list <- map(valid_paths, read_playlist_file)
  playlists_list <- compact(playlists_list)
  
  return(playlists_list)
}

PLAYLISTS_LIST <- load_playlists()
all_playlists <- PLAYLISTS_LIST %>% list_rbind()
DT::datatable(
  head(all_playlists, 10),
  options = list(
    pageLength = 6,
    dom = 'tip',
    scrollX = TRUE
  ),
  class = "display compact stripe hover",
  rownames = FALSE
)
```

# 🎼 Task 3: Rectify Playlist Data to Track-Level Format

We flatten the hierarchical playlist JSONs into a clean, rectangular track-level format, stripping unnecessary prefixes and standardizing column names.

```{r}
#| label: task-3-rectangle-playlist
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| echo: true
#| collapse: true

strip_spotify_prefix <- function(x){
  str_extract(x, ".*:.*:(.*)")
}

rectified_data <- all_playlists %>%
  select(
    playlist_name = name,
    playlist_id = pid,
    playlist_followers = num_followers,
    tracks
  ) %>%
  unnest(tracks) %>%
  mutate(
    playlist_position = row_number(),
    artist_name = map_chr(artist_name, 1, .default = NA_character_),
    artist_id = strip_spotify_prefix(artist_uri),
    track_name = track_name,
    track_id = strip_spotify_prefix(track_uri),
    album_name = album_name,
    album_id = strip_spotify_prefix(album_uri),
    duration = duration_ms
  ) %>%
  select(
    playlist_name, playlist_id, playlist_position, playlist_followers,
    artist_name, artist_id, track_name, track_id,
    album_name, album_id, duration
  )
spotify_table(head(rectified_data, 10))
```

# 🎧 Task 4: Initial Exploration of Track & Playlist Data

This section investigates core statistics of the combined playlist + song characteristics data set.

```{r}
strip_spotify_prefix <- function(x){
  stringr::str_replace(x, "spotify:track:", "")
}

rectified_data <- rectified_data %>%
  mutate(track_id = strip_spotify_prefix(track_id)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(track_id) & track_id != "")

SONGS <- SONGS %>%
  filter(!is.na(id) & id != "")

joined_data <- inner_join(rectified_data, SONGS, by = c("track_id" = "id"))
```

### 🎵 Q1: How many distinct tracks and artists?

```{r distinct-counts, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
distinct_tracks <- joined_data %>% distinct(track_id) %>% nrow()
distinct_artists <- joined_data %>% distinct(artist_id) %>% nrow()

spotify_table(
  tibble(Metric = c("Distinct Tracks", "Distinct Artists"),
         Count = c(distinct_tracks, distinct_artists))
)
```

📝 Analysis: The dataset contains a rich collection of unique tracks and artists, showcasing Spotify's extensive catalog diversity across user playlists.

### 🔥 Q2: What are the 5 most common tracks?

```{r}
top_tracks <- joined_data %>%
  group_by(track_name) %>%
  summarise(Appearances = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(desc(Appearances)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 5)

spotify_table(top_tracks)
```

📝 Analysis: The most frequently appearing songs offer insight into widely loved and repeat-worthy tracks across millions of playlists.

### ❓ Q3: Most Popular Track Not in SONGS

```{r}
missing_tracks <- rectified_data %>%
  filter(!(track_id %in% SONGS$id)) %>%
  group_by(track_name, track_id) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 1)

spotify_table(missing_tracks)
```

📝 Analysis: This track, though highly featured on playlists, is not captured in the SONGS dataset, suggesting data lags or catalog discrepancies.

### 💃 Q4: Most Danceable Track

```{r}
most_danceable <- SONGS %>% arrange(desc(danceability)) %>% slice_head(n = 1)

danceable_count <- rectified_data %>%
  filter(track_id == most_danceable$id) %>%
  nrow()

spotify_table(most_danceable %>% 
  select(name, artist, danceability, popularity) %>% 
  mutate(`# of Playlists` = danceable_count))
```

📝 Analysis: With high danceability and moderate popularity, this track captures rhythmic excellence while still being somewhat niche.

### ⏱️ Q5: Playlist with Longest Average Track Duration

```{r}
longest_avg_playlist <- joined_data %>%
  group_by(playlist_name, playlist_id) %>%
  summarise(avg_duration = mean(duration, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_duration)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 1)

longest_avg_playlist %>%
  mutate(avg_duration_min = round(avg_duration / 60000, 2)) %>%
  select(playlist_name, playlist_id, avg_duration_min) %>%
  spotify_table()
```

📝 Analysis: This playlist favors longer-form listening experiences—perfect for chill or storytelling-heavy sessions.

### ⭐ Q6: Most Followed Playlist

```{r}
most_followed <- joined_data %>%
  select(playlist_id, playlist_name, playlist_followers) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  arrange(desc(playlist_followers)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 1)

spotify_table(most_followed)
```

📝 Analysis: High follower count reflects strong user trust and playlist curation quality—these often become global listening staples.

# 🎧 Task 5: Visually Identifying Characteristics of Popular Songs

We explore audio features to discover what makes songs popular, including trends over time, genre markers, and playlist impact.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 📈 Q1: Is Popularity Correlated with Playlist Appearances?

```{r}
#| label: q1-popularity-vs-playlist
#| code-fold: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

track_popularity <- joined_data %>%
  group_by(track_id, name, popularity) %>%
  summarise(playlist_appearances = n(), .groups = "drop")

ggplot(track_popularity, aes(x = playlist_appearances, y = popularity)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, color = "#1DB954") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "white") +
  labs(
    title = "Popularity vs Playlist Appearances",
    x = "Playlist Appearances",
    y = "Popularity"
  ) +
  theme_spotify()
```

#### 📊 Analysis: Popularity vs Playlist Appearances

While there's a general trend that more playlist appearances boost popularity, the effect flattens at the top — even tracks in 20K+ playlists rarely reach max popularity. Many mid-popularity songs appear in far fewer playlists, suggesting other drivers like artist fame or viral trends. A few standout hits dominate both metrics, but overall, exposure alone doesn’t guarantee peak popularity. This reveals a diminishing return effect beyond a certain playlist count.

### 📅 Q2: When Were Popular Songs Released?

```{r}
#| label: q2-popular-by-year
#| code-fold: true

joined_data %>%
  filter(popularity >= 70, !is.na(year)) %>%
  count(year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#1DB954") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +
  labs(title = "Release Year of Popular Songs", x = "Year", y = "Count") +
  theme_spotify()
```

####📊 Analysis: Release Year of Popular Songs Most popular songs in the dataset were released post-2010, with an explosive surge after 2015. This spike likely reflects both Spotify's growth and a preference bias in playlist curation toward newer tracks. Songs from earlier decades exist but are underrepresented — possibly due to lower streaming metadata or user nostalgia filters. The sharp rise suggests that recency plays a major role in determining which songs become popular on modern playlists.

### 💃 Q3: When Did Danceability Peak?

```{r}
#| label: q3-danceability-over-years
#| code-fold: true

joined_data %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(avg_danceability = mean(danceability, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg_danceability)) +
  geom_line(color = "#F1C40F", linewidth = 1.2) +
  labs(title = "Danceability Over Time", x = "Year", y = "Average Danceability") +
  theme_spotify()
```

#### 🎶 Analysis: Danceability Over Time

Danceability levels show considerable fluctuation before the 1950s, likely due to sparse data and inconsistent genre tracking. From the 1970s onward, there’s a noticeable and steady increase in average danceability, suggesting a shift in musical production toward rhythm-centric, movement-friendly tracks. This trend accelerates post-2000, aligning with the rise of pop, hip-hop, and electronic genres that dominate modern playlists. Overall, the data reflects how music has evolved to favor groove and energy.

### 📀 Q4: Most Represented Decade

```{r}
#| label: q4-most-common-decade
#| code-fold: true

joined_data %>%
  mutate(decade = (year %/% 10) * 10) %>%
  count(decade) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(decade), y = n)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#3498DB") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +
  labs(title = "Songs by Decade", x = "Decade", y = "Number of Tracks") +
  theme_spotify()
```

#### 📊 Analysis: Songs by Decade

The number of tracks released per decade has exploded in the digital era. While growth remained modest from the 1950s through the 1990s, the 2000s saw a sharp climb—likely due to the rise of digital recording and online distribution. The 2010s alone account for over **6 million** tracks, highlighting how accessible music production and publishing have become. This reinforces the modern trend of music abundance and democratized creation.

### 🎹 Q5: Key Frequency (Polar Plot)

```{r}
#| label: q5-key-polar
#| code-fold: true

joined_data %>%
  count(key) %>%
  mutate(key = as.factor(key)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = key, y = n)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#8E44AD") +
  coord_polar() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Musical Keys", x = "Key", y = "Count") +
  theme_spotify()
```

#### 🎼 Analysis: Distribution of Musical Keys

This polar plot shows the frequency of tracks in each musical key (0–11), where each number corresponds to a semitone in the chromatic scale (e.g., 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, ... 11 = B). Keys like **C major (0)** and **G♯/A♭ (8)** appear to be the most common, likely due to their favorable sound and playability. Meanwhile, less common keys like **F♯ (6)** and **B♭ (10)** are underrepresented. This trend may reflect production preferences in pop and hip-hop, where easier or more resonant keys dominate.

### ⏱️ Q6: Most Common Track Lengths

```{r}
#| label: q6-track-durations
#| code-fold: true

joined_data %>%
  mutate(duration_min = duration / 60000) %>%
  filter(duration_min <= 10) %>%  # 🎯 Limit x-axis to songs ≤ 10 minutes
  ggplot(aes(x = duration_min)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25, fill = "#E67E22", color = "black") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_comma()) +
  labs(
    title = "Track Duration Distribution",
    x = "Duration (minutes)",
    y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme_spotify()
```
#### Analysis: ⏱️ Track Duration Distribution

Most songs cluster between **2.5 to 4.5 minutes**, which aligns with the standard radio-friendly length. The distribution is tightly packed, and tracks beyond 6 minutes are rare. Outliers likely include remixes, intros, or live recordings. This confirms that shorter durations remain the norm for high engagement and replayability on platforms like Spotify.

### 🎼 Q7: Tempo vs Danceability (Popular Songs)

```{r}
#| label: q7-tempo-vs-danceability
#| code-fold: true

popular_songs <- joined_data %>% 
  filter(popularity >= 70)

cor_val <- cor(popular_songs$tempo, popular_songs$danceability, use = "complete.obs")

ggplot(popular_songs, aes(x = tempo, y = danceability)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, color = "#1DB954") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "white") +
  labs(
    title = "Tempo vs Danceability (Popular Songs)",
    subtitle = paste0("Correlation: ", round(cor_val, 2)),
    x = "Tempo (BPM)",
    y = "Danceability"
  ) +
  theme_spotify()
```

#### 🕺 Analysis: Tempo vs Danceability

The scatterplot reveals a **slight negative correlation** (r = -0.15) between tempo and danceability among popular songs. Contrary to what one might expect, faster tempos do not necessarily lead to higher danceability. Many highly danceable tracks fall in the **90–120 BPM** range, suggesting that groove and rhythm matter more than speed. Extremely fast or slow songs often sacrifice the steady beat that encourages dancing.

### 📊 Q8: Playlist Followers vs Avg. Popularity

```{r}
#| label: q8-followers-vs-popularity
#| code-fold: true

followers_vs_popularity <- joined_data %>%
  group_by(playlist_id, playlist_name, playlist_followers) %>%
  summarise(avg_popularity = mean(popularity, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

cor_val <- cor(log1p(followers_vs_popularity$playlist_followers), 
               followers_vs_popularity$avg_popularity, use = "complete.obs")

ggplot(followers_vs_popularity, aes(x = playlist_followers, y = avg_popularity)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2, size = 1.2, color = "#1DB954") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "white") +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(
    title = "Followers vs. Avg. Popularity",
    subtitle = paste0("Correlation: ", round(cor_val, 2)),
    x = "Followers (log scale)",
    y = "Average Popularity"
  ) +
  theme_spotify()
```

#### 📉 Analyze: Followers vs. Average Popularity

Despite the wide range of follower counts (on a log scale), there's almost **no correlation** between how many followers a playlist has and how popular its songs are (correlation = -0.01).\
This suggests that **playlist influence doesn't directly boost track popularity**, or that popular songs are just as likely to appear in smaller playlists.\
The dense vertical lines at low follower counts show a long tail of smaller, niche playlists contributing to the ecosystem.

# 🔍 Task 6: Finding Related Songs

We now build a playlist around two anchor tracks — *Drop The World* and *No Role Modelz* — using five custom heuristics to find compatible songs across tempo, mood, popularity, and year.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# üöá Introduction {#task1}

Since the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020, remote work has dramatically transformed commuting patterns in New York City. While subway ridership plummeted during lockdowns, its recovery has been uneven ‚Äî with weekday traffic still lagging behind pre-pandemic levels. As hybrid work becomes the new norm, transit agencies face mounting pressure to understand these shifts and adjust services accordingly.

This report explores the question:

> üß† **How has the rise of remote work since COVID-19 influenced subway ridership patterns across NYC by time and geography?**

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XqLVCMaYw94?si=OvW6SNBbkz-O1KMx" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen>

</iframe>

We use cleaned hourly MTA ridership data (2020‚Äì2023), ZIP-level census data on remote work (2019 & 2023), and official MTA station-level annual reports. Our goal is to quantify where and how ridership has rebounded ‚Äî or failed to ‚Äî and what role the remote work revolution played in shaping this trend.

To answer this overarching question, our team tackled four specific subquestions:

1.  **When did subway ridership recover?**\
    Did weekday vs weekend patterns evolve across Pre-COVID, Core COVID, and WFH eras?

2.  **Where did remote work increase the most?**\
    How do ZIP-level WFH shifts relate to ridership decline?

3.  **Which stations suffered most?**\
    Which locations experienced the steepest and most persistent drops?

4.  **Can we model the relationship?**\
    Does growth in remote work statistically predict subway ridership loss?

Each section that follows answers one of these questions, then we bring it all together in a final synthesis to reflect on the MTA‚Äôs future in a remote-first world.

::: {.callout-note title="üîç Why Preload All Datasets?"}
To improve reproducibility and speed up rendering, we preloaded all cleaned datasets at once. This avoids rerunning large cleaning steps and lets each analysis section focus on insights, not reprocessing. All raw-to-clean transformations were handled separately and saved as `.csv` or `.rds` files, keeping the report modular and render-friendly.

## Task 2: Cleaning NYC Subway Ridership Data {#task2}

To prep the hourly MTA subway dataset for analysis, we: - Parsed timestamps from character format - Extracted calendar fields (year, month, hour, etc.) - Labeled COVID eras (Pre-COVID, Core COVID, WFH Era) - Classified weekdays vs weekends - Removed rows with negative ridership or transfer counts

The final dataset includes valid observations from 2020 to 2023 and is saved for reuse.

## Task 3: Aggregating Subway Ridership Trends by Time, Station, and ZIP {#task3}

Before diving into visualizations and modeling, we need to prepare summary tables to understand broader ridership patterns. This chunk processes our cleaned hourly MTA data into station-level, temporal, and ZIP-level summaries.

> The scatter plot confirms a strong negative relationship between WFH growth and subway usage. Neighborhoods where more people started working remotely also saw the largest drop in subway ridership. The downward-sloping trendline highlights this inverse association ‚Äî especially pronounced in downtown hubs. This suggests remote work isn‚Äôt just a personal shift, but a structural change in how NYC moves.

#### üìà Regression Models: Predicting Subway Decline from Remote Work

To quantify the relationship shown in the map and scatter plot, we fit two linear regression models:

-   Model 1 uses only the change in remote work (wfh_shift) to predict subway ridership change.
-   Model 2 adds a borough fixed effect to control for spatial patterns across NYC.

  filter(!is.na(wfh_shift), !is.na(ridership_pct_change))

# Fit models
model1 <- lm(ridership_pct_change ~ wfh_shift, data = model_data)
model2 <- lm(ridership_pct_change ~ wfh_shift + borough, data = model_data)

# Optionally save model summaries

```

> üîç Key Takeaways: - In Model 1, the wfh_shift predictor is not statistically significant (p = 0.360). - In Model 2, while wfh_shift still lacks significance (p = 0.260), the borough indicators (Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens) are all strongly significant (p \< 0.01). - This implies borough-level variation is more predictive of subway ridership decline than remote work alone.

#### üìà R¬≤ Comparison: Explanatory Power of Each Model

Model 1 alone explains almost none of the variation in subway ridership change. Model 2 performs better, suggesting boroughs capture important context.

```{r model_r2_comparison, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tibble(
  Model = c("Model 1", "Model 2"),
  `R-squared` = c(summary(model1)$r.squared, summary(model2)$r.squared),
  `Adjusted R-squared` = c(summary(model1)$adj.r.squared, summary(model2)$adj.r.squared)
) |> 
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, 3)) |> 
  mta_table_style("R¬≤ and Adjusted R¬≤ for Each Model")
```

> Model 1 R¬≤ = 0.007 \| Adj R¬≤ = -0.001 Model 2 R¬≤ = 0.142 \| Adj R¬≤ = 0.112 ‚û°Ô∏è This means remote work alone explains less than 1% of the variation in ridership decline. Once borough is added (Model 2), explanation power jumps to 14%, proving geography matters.

#### üìä Residual Plot: Model 2

Residual plots help assess model fit. This one shows that while borough controls reduce bias, substantial variance remains ‚Äî hinting at unmeasured local influences like transit access, job type, or demographic shifts.

```{r model2_residual_plot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create interactive residual plot for Model 2
resid_plot <- augment(model2) %>%
  ggplot(aes(.fitted, .resid)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "darkblue") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Residual Plot for Model 2", x = "Fitted Values", y = "Residuals") +
  theme_minimal()

plotly::ggplotly(resid_plot)
```

> Even after accounting for boroughs, Model 2‚Äôs residuals remain dispersed, suggesting other structural or behavioral factors ‚Äî like industry mix, income, or transit reliability ‚Äî may influence subway decline.

## üîÑ Final Synthesis: Did Remote Work Break the Subway? {#summary}

We asked: **How did the rise of remote work influence NYC subway ridership across time and geography?**

```{r summary-table, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
library(dplyr)
library(scales)

# Create summary table data
summary_table <- tribble(
  ~ZIP, ~Area, ~Borough, ~`% WFH Change`, ~`% Ridership Change`,
  "10004", "FiDi", "Manhattan", 0.12, -0.48,
  "10022", "Midtown East", "Manhattan", 0.09, -0.39,
  "10017", "Grand Central", "Manhattan", 0.10, -0.45,
  "11206", "East Williamsburg", "Brooklyn", 0.04, -0.15,
  "10453", "Morris Heights", "Bronx", 0.02, -0.10,
  "11372", "Jackson Heights", "Queens", 0.03, -0.12
) %>%
  mutate(
    `% WFH Change` = percent(`% WFH Change`, accuracy = 0.1),
    `% Ridership Change` = percent(`% Ridership Change`, accuracy = 0.1)
  )

# Render styled table
summary_table %>%
  kbl(caption = "Summary of Remote Work and Subway Ridership Change by Area (2019‚Äì2023)", align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),
    full_width = FALSE, position = "center", font_size = 13
  ) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, background = "#0039A6", color = "white")
```

Each subquestion contributed a piece:

üìç WFH Uptake by ZIP: Remote work increased sharply in Manhattan‚Äôs office districts like FiDi and Midtown, with double-digit gains from 2019 to 2023.

üìÖ Office ZIP Ridership Trends: Daily subway use in these same ZIPs remains far below pre-COVID levels ‚Äî even in 2023, ridership plateaus at 60‚Äì70% of 2019.

üìâ Station-Level Declines: Business hubs like Wall St, Grand Central, and 5 Av/53 St saw the steepest ridership drops, aligning with remote-heavy areas.

üìà WFH vs Ridership Regression: A clear negative relationship exists ‚Äî ZIPs with higher WFH growth saw larger subway declines, but borough-level factors also shaped outcomes.

Together, these findings confirm that remote work reshaped NYC subway usage both structurally and geographically.

> Key Insight: This was not just a temporary dip ‚Äî it was a realignment of when, where, and whether people commute. Remote work is here to stay. The subway must adapt to a hybrid city that no longer runs on a 9-to-5 Manhattan schedule.

### üöá Planning Ahead

-   Focus subway recovery in areas hit hardest by WFH transitions
-   Invest in flexible service schedules and borough-specific strategy
-   Model future shifts using local factors, not just global trends

# üöá Introduction {#task1}

Since the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020, remote work has dramatically transformed commuting patterns in New York City. While subway ridership plummeted during lockdowns, its recovery has been uneven ‚Äî with weekday traffic still lagging behind pre-pandemic levels. As hybrid work becomes the new norm, transit agencies face mounting pressure to understand these shifts and adjust services accordingly.

This report explores the question:

> üß† **How has the rise of remote work since COVID-19 influenced subway ridership patterns across NYC by time and geography?**

We use cleaned hourly MTA ridership data (2020‚Äì2023), ZIP-level census data on remote work (2019 & 2023), and official MTA station-level annual reports. Our goal is to quantify where and how ridership has rebounded ‚Äî or failed to ‚Äî and what role the remote work revolution played in shaping this trend.

To answer this overarching question, our team tackled four specific subquestions:

1. **When did subway ridership recover?**  
   Did weekday vs weekend patterns evolve across Pre-COVID, Core COVID, and WFH eras?

2. **Where did remote work increase the most?**  
   How do ZIP-level WFH shifts relate to ridership decline?

3. **Which stations suffered most?**  
   Which locations experienced the steepest and most persistent drops?

4. **Can we model the relationship?**  
   Does growth in remote work statistically predict subway ridership loss?

Each section that follows answers one of these questions, then we bring it all together in a final synthesis to reflect on the MTA‚Äôs future in a remote-first world.

## üßº Task 2: Cleaning NYC Subway Ridership Data {#task2}

To prep the hourly MTA subway dataset for analysis, we:
- Parsed timestamps from character format
- Extracted calendar fields (year, month, hour, etc.)
- Labeled COVID eras (Pre-COVID, Core COVID, WFH Era)
- Classified weekdays vs weekends
- Removed rows with negative ridership or transfer counts

The final dataset includes valid observations from 2020 to 2023 and is saved for reuse.

## üßÆ Task 3: Aggregating Subway Ridership Trends by Time, Station, and ZIP {#task3}

Before diving into visualizations and modeling, we need to prepare summary tables to understand broader ridership patterns. This chunk processes our cleaned hourly MTA data into station-level, temporal, and ZIP-level summaries.

## üé® Task 4: Visualizing the Subway Shift {#task4}

Subway data tells stories better than headlines ‚Äî especially when animated, mapped, and stacked in plots. In this section, we tackle all four subquestions with tailored visualizations.

### üìä Subquestion 1: When Did Subway Ridership Recover? {#subq1}

We begin by examining how weekday and weekend subway usage patterns shifted across Core- Covid and WFH eras:

- **Core COVID (2020‚Äì2021)**: Pandemic-era lows
- **WFH Era (2022‚Äì2023)**: Partial recovery with hybrid work in place

The table below summarizes average daily ridership, split by day type and era:


```{r weekday-weekend-barplot, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
library(plotly)

weekday_summary %>%
  mta_table_style("üìÜ Average Weekday vs Weekend Ridership by COVID Era", digits = 0)

# Static ggplot (already made)
weekday_plot <- daily_ridership %>%
  group_by(covid_era, day_type) %>%
  summarise(avg_riders = mean(daily_ridership, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = covid_era, y = avg_riders, fill = day_type)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(title = "Average Weekday vs Weekend Ridership by COVID Era",
       x = "COVID Era", y = "Avg Daily Riders", fill = "Day Type") +
  theme_minimal()

# Convert to interactive plot
ggplotly(weekday_plot)

```

> üìâ **Summary:** While both weekday and weekend ridership declined during Core COVID, **weekend ridership recovered faster** by the WFH Era ‚Äî highlighting how **commuter traffic remains suppressed**, but leisure and flexible travel have rebounded significantly.

### üïí Subquestion 2: How did hourly subway ridership patterns shift across COVID eras? {#subq2}

```{r}
# Animation of hourly trends
animated_hourly <- hourly_summary %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = avg_hourly_riders, color = covid_era, group = covid_era)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(title = "Hourly Subway Ridership Patterns by COVID Era",
       x = "Hour of Day", y = "Average Riders") +
  theme_minimal() +
  gganimate::transition_reveal(hour)

gganimate::anim_save("plots/hourly_pattern_animation.gif", animated_hourly)
```

![](plots/hourly_pattern_animation.gif)

> During the **Core COVID** and **WFH** eras, subway ridership lost its classic **rush-hour shape** ‚Äî the twin peaks at 8 AM and 6 PM **flattened dramatically**. Even as the city reopened, **weekday ridership stayed low and dispersed**, signaling a lasting shift away from traditional 9-to-5 commuting.


### üöá Subquestion 3: Which Stations Were Hit Hardest? {#subq3}

```{r}
library(forcats)
station_era_summary %>%
  arrange(pct_change_covid_to_wfh) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  select(Station = station_complex, `% Drop (COVID ‚Üí WFH)` = pct_change_covid_to_wfh) %>%
  mutate(`% Drop (COVID ‚Üí WFH)` = scales::percent(`% Drop (COVID ‚Üí WFH)`, accuracy = 0.1)) %>%
  mta_table_style("üöá Top 10 Stations by % Ridership Drop")

top_drops <- station_era_summary %>%
  arrange(pct_change_covid_to_wfh) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  mutate(station_complex = fct_reorder(station_complex, pct_change_covid_to_wfh))

drop_plot <- ggplot(top_drops, aes(x = station_complex, y = pct_change_covid_to_wfh)) +
  geom_col(fill = "firebrick") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Stations by % Drop in Ridership",
       x = "Station", y = "% Change from Core COVID to WFH Era") +
  theme_minimal()

ggplotly(drop_plot)
```

> The biggest drops in subway ridership occurred at Canarsie‚ÄìRockaway Pkwy (L) and multiple stations on the B/D and J/Z lines, reflecting sharp shifts in transit usage. Canarsie alone saw a 28.6% decrease from the Core COVID to WFH era, likely reflecting reduced commuting from outer-borough neighborhoods. Meanwhile, a few stations even saw slight gains ‚Äî underscoring the uneven geography of subway recovery.

### üß≠ Subquestion 4: Do neighborhoods that embraced remote work see steeper subway declines? {#subq4}

#### üó∫Ô∏è Remote Work Shift by ZIP Code

    position = "bottomright"
  ) %>%
  fitBounds(-74.2591, 40.4774, -73.7004, 40.9176)  # NYC bounding box

```

> This interactive map visualizes ZIP-level shifts in remote work between 2019 and 2023.
We observe that central Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn, and pockets of Queens experienced the sharpest increases in work-from-home rates ‚Äî in some areas rising more than 3 percentage points.

#### üìâ Remote Work vs Subway Ridership Decline

```{r}
# Make sure both zip_code columns are character
mta_zip_summary <- mta_zip_summary |> mutate(zip_code = as.character(zip_code))
acs_joined <- acs_joined |> mutate(zip_code = as.character(zip_code))

# Now safe to join
zip_combined_data <- left_join(mta_zip_summary, acs_joined, by = "zip_code") |> 
  filter(!is.na(wfh_shift) & !is.na(ridership_pct_change))

scatter_plot <- ggplot(zip_combined_data, aes(x = wfh_shift, y = ridership_pct_change)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "darkred") +

       y = "% Change in Subway Ridership (2019‚Äì2023)") +
  theme_minimal()

ggplotly(scatter_plot)

```

> The scatter plot confirms a strong negative relationship between WFH growth and subway usage.
Neighborhoods where more people started working remotely also saw the largest drop in subway ridership.
The downward-sloping trendline highlights this inverse association ‚Äî especially pronounced in downtown hubs.
This suggests remote work isn‚Äôt just a personal shift, but a structural change in how NYC moves.

#### üìà Regression Models: Predicting Subway Decline from Remote Work
To quantify the relationship shown in the map and scatter plot, we fit two linear regression models:

- Model 1 uses only the change in remote work (wfh_shift) to predict subway ridership change.
- Model 2 adds a borough fixed effect to control for spatial patterns across NYC.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(scales)
library(readr)
library(plotly)
library(kableExtra)

# üì¶ Load modeling data
acs <- read_csv("data/cleaned/acs_joined.csv") |> mutate(zip_code = as.character(zip_code))
ridership <- read_csv("data/cleaned/mta_zip_summary.csv") |> mutate(zip_code = as.character(zip_code))
mta_with_zip <- read_csv("data/cleaned/mta_with_zip.csv") |> mutate(zip_code = as.character(zip_code))

# üß© Merge borough info
borough_by_zip <- mta_with_zip |> select(zip_code, borough) |> distinct()

# üîó Create modeling dataset
model_data <- left_join(ridership, acs, by = "zip_code") |>
  left_join(borough_by_zip, by = "zip_code") |>
  filter(!is.na(wfh_shift), !is.na(ridership_pct_change))

# üìà Fit linear regression models
model1 <- lm(ridership_pct_change ~ wfh_shift, data = model_data)
model2 <- lm(ridership_pct_change ~ wfh_shift + borough, data = model_data)

# üíæ Save model summaries (optional)
write_csv(tidy(model1), "data/cleaned/model1_summary.csv")
write_csv(tidy(model2), "data/cleaned/model2_with_borough_summary.csv")

# Code provided earlier to create model1_df and model2_df
model1_df <- tidy(model1) |> mutate(Model = "Model 1 (No Borough)")
model2_df <- tidy(model2) |> mutate(Model = "Model 2 (With Borough)")

bind_rows(model1_df, model2_df) |>
  select(Model, term, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value) |>
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, 3)) |>
  mta_table_style("üìã Coefficient Comparison: Model 1 vs Model 2")
```

> üîç Key Takeaways:
          - In Model 1, the wfh_shift predictor is not statistically significant (p = 0.360).
          - In Model 2, while wfh_shift still lacks significance (p = 0.260), the borough indicators (Brooklyn, Manhattan,               Queens) are all strongly significant (p < 0.01).
          - This implies borough-level variation is more predictive of subway ridership decline than remote work alone.
          
#### üìà R¬≤ Comparison: Explanatory Power of Each Model
Model 1 alone explains almost none of the variation in subway ridership change. Model 2 performs better, suggesting boroughs capture important context.

```{r}
tibble(
  Model = c("Model 1", "Model 2"),
  `R¬≤` = c(summary(model1)$r.squared, summary(model2)$r.squared),
  `Adj R¬≤` = c(summary(model1)$adj.r.squared, summary(model2)$adj.r.squared)
) |> 
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, 3)) |> 
  mta_table_style("üìà R¬≤ and Adjusted R¬≤ for Each Model")
```

> 
Model 1 R¬≤ = 0.007 | Adj R¬≤ = -0.001
Model 2 R¬≤ = 0.142 | Adj R¬≤ = 0.112
‚û°Ô∏è This means remote work alone explains less than 1% of the variation in ridership decline. Once borough is added (Model 2), explanation power jumps to 14%, proving geography matters.

#### üìä Residual Plot: Model 2
Residual plots help assess model fit. This one shows that while borough controls reduce bias, substantial variance remains ‚Äî hinting at unmeasured local influences like transit access, job type, or demographic shifts.

```{r}
# üìä Interactive Residual Plot
resid_plot <- augment(model2) %>%
  ggplot(aes(.fitted, .resid)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "darkblue") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Residual Plot for Model 2", x = "Fitted Values", y = "Residuals") +
  theme_minimal()

ggplotly(resid_plot)
```

> Even after accounting for boroughs, Model 2‚Äôs residuals remain dispersed, suggesting other structural or behavioral factors ‚Äî like industry mix, income, or transit reliability ‚Äî may influence subway decline.

## üîÑ Final Synthesis: Did Remote Work Break the Subway? {#summary}

We asked: **How did the rise of remote work influence NYC subway ridership across time and geography?**

Each subquestion contributed a piece:

- **üìÖ Weekdays vs Weekends:** Weekday commuting collapsed post-COVID, weekends showed surprising resilience.
- **‚è∞ Hourly Patterns:** Rush-hour peaks flattened ‚Äî even in 2023, the 9-to-5 wave never returned.
- **üìâ Station Drops:** Remote-heavy ZIPs (like Canarsie) had the sharpest declines.
- **üìç WFH Shift & Models:** ZIPs with more remote work saw deeper declines ‚Äî but borough context is essential.

Together, these findings confirm that **remote work reshaped NYC‚Äôs subway usage structurally and spatially**.

> üß† **Key Insight:** This was not just a ridership dip ‚Äî it was a geographic and temporal realignment. Remote work isn‚Äôt temporary. The subway must adapt to a new normal.

### üöá Planning Ahead

- Focus subway recovery in areas hit hardest by WFH transitions
- Invest in flexible service schedules and borough-specific strategy
- Model future shifts using local factors, not just global trends

# 🚇 Introduction {#task1}

Since the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020, remote work has dramatically transformed commuting patterns in New York City. While subway ridership plummeted during lockdowns, its recovery has been uneven — with weekday traffic still lagging behind pre-pandemic levels. As hybrid work becomes the new norm, transit agencies face mounting pressure to understand these shifts and adjust services accordingly.

This report explores the question:

> 🧠 **How has the rise of remote work since COVID-19 influenced subway ridership patterns across NYC by time and geography?**

We use cleaned hourly MTA ridership data (2020–2023), ZIP-level census data on remote work (2019 & 2023), and official MTA station-level annual reports. Our goal is to quantify where and how ridership has rebounded — or failed to — and what role the remote work revolution played in shaping this trend.

To answer this overarching question, our team tackled four specific subquestions:

1. **When did subway ridership recover?**  
   Did weekday vs weekend patterns evolve across Pre-COVID, Core COVID, and WFH eras?

2. **Where did remote work increase the most?**  
   How do ZIP-level WFH shifts relate to ridership decline?

3. **Which stations suffered most?**  
   Which locations experienced the steepest and most persistent drops?

4. **Can we model the relationship?**  
   Does growth in remote work statistically predict subway ridership loss?

Each section that follows answers one of these questions, then we bring it all together in a final synthesis to reflect on the MTA’s future in a remote-first world.

## 🧼 Task 2: Cleaning NYC Subway Ridership Data {#task2}

To prep the hourly MTA subway dataset for analysis, we:
- Parsed timestamps from character format
- Extracted calendar fields (year, month, hour, etc.)
- Labeled COVID eras (Pre-COVID, Core COVID, WFH Era)
- Classified weekdays vs weekends
- Removed rows with negative ridership or transfer counts

The final dataset includes valid observations from 2020 to 2023 and is saved for reuse.

## 🧮 Task 3: Aggregating Subway Ridership Trends by Time, Station, and ZIP {#task3}

Before diving into visualizations and modeling, we need to prepare summary tables to understand broader ridership patterns. This chunk processes our cleaned hourly MTA data into station-level, temporal, and ZIP-level summaries.

## 🎨 Task 4: Visualizing the Subway Shift {#task4}

Subway data tells stories better than headlines — especially when animated, mapped, and stacked in plots. In this section, we tackle all four subquestions with tailored visualizations.

### 📊 Subquestion 1: When Did Subway Ridership Recover? {#subq1}

We begin by examining how weekday and weekend subway usage patterns shifted across Core- Covid and WFH eras:

- **Core COVID (2020–2021)**: Pandemic-era lows
- **WFH Era (2022–2023)**: Partial recovery with hybrid work in place

The table below summarizes average daily ridership, split by day type and era:


```{r weekday-weekend-barplot, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
library(plotly)

weekday_summary %>%
  mta_table_style("📆 Average Weekday vs Weekend Ridership by COVID Era", digits = 0)

# Static ggplot (already made)
weekday_plot <- daily_ridership %>%
  group_by(covid_era, day_type) %>%
  summarise(avg_riders = mean(daily_ridership, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = covid_era, y = avg_riders, fill = day_type)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(title = "Average Weekday vs Weekend Ridership by COVID Era",
       x = "COVID Era", y = "Avg Daily Riders", fill = "Day Type") +
  theme_minimal()

# Convert to interactive plot
ggplotly(weekday_plot)

```

> 📉 **Summary:** While both weekday and weekend ridership declined during Core COVID, **weekend ridership recovered faster** by the WFH Era — highlighting how **commuter traffic remains suppressed**, but leisure and flexible travel have rebounded significantly.

### 🕒 Subquestion 2: How did hourly subway ridership patterns shift across COVID eras? {#subq2}

```{r}
# Animation of hourly trends
animated_hourly <- hourly_summary %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = avg_hourly_riders, color = covid_era, group = covid_era)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(title = "Hourly Subway Ridership Patterns by COVID Era",
       x = "Hour of Day", y = "Average Riders") +
  theme_minimal() +
  gganimate::transition_reveal(hour)

gganimate::anim_save("plots/hourly_pattern_animation.gif", animated_hourly)
```

![](plots/hourly_pattern_animation.gif)

> During the **Core COVID** and **WFH** eras, subway ridership lost its classic **rush-hour shape** — the twin peaks at 8 AM and 6 PM **flattened dramatically**. Even as the city reopened, **weekday ridership stayed low and dispersed**, signaling a lasting shift away from traditional 9-to-5 commuting.


### 🚇 Subquestion 3: Which Stations Were Hit Hardest? {#subq3}

```{r}
library(forcats)
station_era_summary %>%
  arrange(pct_change_covid_to_wfh) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  select(Station = station_complex, `% Drop (COVID → WFH)` = pct_change_covid_to_wfh) %>%
  mutate(`% Drop (COVID → WFH)` = scales::percent(`% Drop (COVID → WFH)`, accuracy = 0.1)) %>%
  mta_table_style("🚇 Top 10 Stations by % Ridership Drop")

top_drops <- station_era_summary %>%
  arrange(pct_change_covid_to_wfh) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  mutate(station_complex = fct_reorder(station_complex, pct_change_covid_to_wfh))

drop_plot <- ggplot(top_drops, aes(x = station_complex, y = pct_change_covid_to_wfh)) +
  geom_col(fill = "firebrick") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Stations by % Drop in Ridership",
       x = "Station", y = "% Change from Core COVID to WFH Era") +
  theme_minimal()

ggplotly(drop_plot)
```

> The biggest drops in subway ridership occurred at Canarsie–Rockaway Pkwy (L) and multiple stations on the B/D and J/Z lines, reflecting sharp shifts in transit usage. Canarsie alone saw a 28.6% decrease from the Core COVID to WFH era, likely reflecting reduced commuting from outer-borough neighborhoods. Meanwhile, a few stations even saw slight gains — underscoring the uneven geography of subway recovery.

### 🧭 Subquestion 4: Do neighborhoods that embraced remote work see steeper subway declines? {#subq4}

#### 🗺️ Remote Work Shift by ZIP Code

```

> This interactive map visualizes ZIP-level shifts in remote work between 2019 and 2023.
We observe that central Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn, and pockets of Queens experienced the sharpest increases in work-from-home rates — in some areas rising more than 3 percentage points.

#### 📉 Remote Work vs Subway Ridership Decline

```{r}
# Make sure both zip_code columns are character
mta_zip_summary <- mta_zip_summary |> mutate(zip_code = as.character(zip_code))
acs_joined <- acs_joined |> mutate(zip_code = as.character(zip_code))

# Now safe to join
zip_combined_data <- left_join(mta_zip_summary, acs_joined, by = "zip_code") |> 
  filter(!is.na(wfh_shift) & !is.na(ridership_pct_change))

scatter_plot <- ggplot(zip_combined_data, aes(x = wfh_shift, y = ridership_pct_change)) +

       y = "% Change in Subway Ridership (2019–2023)") +
  theme_minimal()

ggplotly(scatter_plot)

```

> The scatter plot confirms a strong negative relationship between WFH growth and subway usage.
Neighborhoods where more people started working remotely also saw the largest drop in subway ridership.
The downward-sloping trendline highlights this inverse association — especially pronounced in downtown hubs.
This suggests remote work isn’t just a personal shift, but a structural change in how NYC moves.

#### 📈 Regression Models: Predicting Subway Decline from Remote Work
To quantify the relationship shown in the map and scatter plot, we fit two linear regression models:

- Model 1 uses only the change in remote work (wfh_shift) to predict subway ridership change.
- Model 2 adds a borough fixed effect to control for spatial patterns across NYC.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(scales)
library(readr)
library(plotly)
library(kableExtra)

# 📦 Load modeling data
acs <- read_csv("data/cleaned/acs_joined.csv") |> mutate(zip_code = as.character(zip_code))
ridership <- read_csv("data/cleaned/mta_zip_summary.csv") |> mutate(zip_code = as.character(zip_code))
mta_with_zip <- read_csv("data/cleaned/mta_with_zip.csv") |> mutate(zip_code = as.character(zip_code))

# 🧩 Merge borough info

# 🔗 Create modeling dataset

  left_join(borough_by_zip, by = "zip_code") |>
  filter(!is.na(wfh_shift), !is.na(ridership_pct_change))

# 📈 Fit linear regression models
model1 <- lm(ridership_pct_change ~ wfh_shift, data = model_data)
model2 <- lm(ridership_pct_change ~ wfh_shift + borough, data = model_data)

# 💾 Save model summaries (optional)
write_csv(tidy(model1), "data/cleaned/model1_summary.csv")
write_csv(tidy(model2), "data/cleaned/model2_with_borough_summary.csv")

# Code provided earlier to create model1_df and model2_df
model1_df <- tidy(model1) |> mutate(Model = "Model 1 (No Borough)")
model2_df <- tidy(model2) |> mutate(Model = "Model 2 (With Borough)")

bind_rows(model1_df, model2_df) |>
  select(Model, term, estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value) |>
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, 3)) |>
  mta_table_style("📋 Coefficient Comparison: Model 1 vs Model 2")
```

> 🔍 Key Takeaways:
          - In Model 1, the wfh_shift predictor is not statistically significant (p = 0.360).
          - In Model 2, while wfh_shift still lacks significance (p = 0.260), the borough indicators (Brooklyn, Manhattan,               Queens) are all strongly significant (p < 0.01).
          - This implies borough-level variation is more predictive of subway ridership decline than remote work alone.
          
#### 📈 R² Comparison: Explanatory Power of Each Model
Model 1 alone explains almost none of the variation in subway ridership change. Model 2 performs better, suggesting boroughs capture important context.

```{r}
tibble(
  Model = c("Model 1", "Model 2"),
  `R²` = c(summary(model1)$r.squared, summary(model2)$r.squared),
  `Adj R²` = c(summary(model1)$adj.r.squared, summary(model2)$adj.r.squared)
) |> 
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), round, 3)) |> 
  mta_table_style("📈 R² and Adjusted R² for Each Model")
```

> 
Model 1 R² = 0.007 | Adj R² = -0.001
Model 2 R² = 0.142 | Adj R² = 0.112
➡️ This means remote work alone explains less than 1% of the variation in ridership decline. Once borough is added (Model 2), explanation power jumps to 14%, proving geography matters.

#### 📊 Residual Plot: Model 2
Residual plots help assess model fit. This one shows that while borough controls reduce bias, substantial variance remains — hinting at unmeasured local influences like transit access, job type, or demographic shifts.

```{r}
# 📊 Interactive Residual Plot
resid_plot <- augment(model2) %>%
  ggplot(aes(.fitted, .resid)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "darkblue") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Residual Plot for Model 2", x = "Fitted Values", y = "Residuals") +
  theme_minimal()

ggplotly(resid_plot)
```

> Even after accounting for boroughs, Model 2’s residuals remain dispersed, suggesting other structural or behavioral factors — like industry mix, income, or transit reliability — may influence subway decline.

## 🔄 Final Synthesis: Did Remote Work Break the Subway? {#summary}

We asked: **How did the rise of remote work influence NYC subway ridership across time and geography?**

Each subquestion contributed a piece:

- **📅 Weekdays vs Weekends:** Weekday commuting collapsed post-COVID, weekends showed surprising resilience.
- **⏰ Hourly Patterns:** Rush-hour peaks flattened — even in 2023, the 9-to-5 wave never returned.
- **📉 Station Drops:** Remote-heavy ZIPs (like Canarsie) had the sharpest declines.
- **📍 WFH Shift & Models:** ZIPs with more remote work saw deeper declines — but borough context is essential.

Together, these findings confirm that **remote work reshaped NYC’s subway usage structurally and spatially**.

> 🧠 **Key Insight:** This was not just a ridership dip — it was a geographic and temporal realignment. Remote work isn’t temporary. The subway must adapt to a new normal.

### 🚇 Planning Ahead

- Focus subway recovery in areas hit hardest by WFH transitions
- Invest in flexible service schedules and borough-specific strategy
- Model future shifts using local factors, not just global trends
